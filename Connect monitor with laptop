DISCLAIMER: This method is found out by myself, so any damage or loss to your laptop or monitor is not my responsibility.
This method will only apply to Windows 10 only. I guess...

1. Firstly, make sure you have HDMI to VGA converter and cable.

2. Next, right click > Display Settings.

3. Moreover, go to Multiple displays and select Extend these displays or Duplicate these displays.

4. Furthermore, if your monitor showing some error messages, such as Input Signmal Out of Range, Change Settings to 1600x900 - 60Hz, 
go to Display resolution to change to the recommended one.

*5. If you face problem like me by changing the Display resolution is not working, then you can try to go to :
Advanced display settings > Choose display (find your monitor display selection)

*6. Besides that, click Display adapter properties for Display 2 (your monitor display selection) 

*7. A pop up box will show up and click Adapter > List All Modes (bottom) > find the suitable resolution for your monitor > OK > Apply. Done.

8. If you still can't solve these problems, please refer to your seller or any other technician for help.
